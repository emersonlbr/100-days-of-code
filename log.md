**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Ajax, how it has changed the way people write web apps, and made room for the PWA's
**Thoughts**: It's pretty neat to get the definition of Ajax, cause even though I have worked with it before I didn't really know what it were about.

**Thoughts**: Watching someone else code it's quite fun and helpful, knowing everyone strugggles while coding actually helps me to know that I am not the only one who, sometimes, have hard times trying to figure out how to do something. The Simmon Game seems just impossible, but I will figure it out.
