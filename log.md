### Day 3: January 8, 2018

### Day 5: January 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Done 3 FCC challenges, watched a lecture about JS in youtube, read a little bit more of eloquent js, watched some css animations tutorial.

**Today's Progress**: It was a very tiring day, didn't have much time, though I've attempted to solve a FCC challenge, and also read more about javascript objects. Watched a documentary about Aaron Swartz, 5 years ago today he had killed himself, victim of an injustice system.
